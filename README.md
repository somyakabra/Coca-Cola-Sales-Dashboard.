I analyze sales, profit margins, prices, regions, and more. First, I started with uploading the dataset from excel using power query. Then, I make the dashbord strucuture by adding headers and shapes. Third, I worked on the following visuals:
1. The AI-powered Q&A visual. 
2. Key infuencers visual in Power BI to analyze profit margins per brand.
3. Map chart to see sales by region
4. Matrix to analyze financials such as price per unit and operating profit.
5. Dynamic timeline for users to change dates
